# Number-Guessing-Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game allows the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The user has five attempts to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user either guesses the correct number or loses.
